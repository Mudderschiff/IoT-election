    MQTT is not suitable. Very involved interactions are hard to model.
    Trust is distributed and mpc want to avoid single point of failure. However, due to communication the broker inavitably becomes a single point of failure. A true d2d communication is needed. Consensus of the Guardians is hard to model. Elect a leader of dishonest majority

    Mesh network inherent decentralised nature is great however, we are limited by the bandwidth of the network. Can adapt to changes to the topology

    The redundancy and self-healing nature of mesh networks could ensure that the necessary quorum of guardians can still communicate and collaborate effectively.

    Device discovery

    Synchronisation challenges.
